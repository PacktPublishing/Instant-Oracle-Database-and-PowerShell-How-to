=====
This script creates an OleDbConnection object; System.Data is loaded by default in PowerShell so there is nothing to load.
Types can be immediately created.

Generally ODP.NET should be used over OLE DB; see Chapter 1 for more information.

See http://sev17.com/2010/03/querying-oracle-from-powershell-part-2/ for more information on using OLE DB
